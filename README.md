Running:

Requires python 3.6 to run.  I recommend running in a virtual environment to avoid conflicts, but it's up to you.

Execute the following commmand from the terminal:
 
 pip install -r requirements.txt 
 
 then execute the command:
 
 python app.py
 
 The server will start up at localhost:5000/
